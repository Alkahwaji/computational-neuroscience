# Overview

This repository contains materials for a short MATLAB and computational neuroscience course, taught at the University of Pennsylvania during the summers of 2009, 2010, and 2011.

You'll probably want to start by downloding [this PDF](https://github.com/ContextLab/computational-neuroscience/blob/master/main.pdf), which contains the syllabus, course notes, and problem sets.

Lecture slides, code, and other materials mat be found by exploring the rest of the repository.
